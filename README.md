# Machine Learning
Practice codes for machine learning.
## Types of machine leaning problems:
* Supervised: Presented with input data and desired outputs and asked to find pattern
  * Image classification 
  * Market prediction/ Rgression
* Unsupervised learning: No labels given, asked to find pattern in input.
  * CLustering
  * High-Dimension Visulization
  * Generative Models
* Semi-supervised learing: Some of the data is labeled
  * Photo archive
* Reinforced Learning: Feedback in terms of reward and punishments
### Types of Supervised Learning:
  * Classification:
    * Binary Classification ( Scam not scam)
    * MUlticlass CLassification
  * Regression: Outputs are continuous rather than discrete
### Types of Unsupervised learning:
  * Clusterning: Groups are not known before hand
  * Density estimation: Find distribution of inputs in space
  * Dimention reduction: Simplifies by mapping them into llower dimension space
### Terms in machine learning:
  * Model or hypothesis
  * Feature
  * Target or label
  * Training
  * Prediction
### Steps of Machine learing:
1. Define the problem
2. Collect data
3. Explore the data
4. Pre-process Data
5. Split the data
6. Chose a model
7. Train the model
8. Evaluate the model
9. Fine tune the model
10. Deploy the model
11. MOnitor the model

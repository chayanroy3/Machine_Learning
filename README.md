# Machine Learning
 computer programs that automatically improve with experience,ability to learn without being explicitly programmed,optimize a performance criterion using example data or past experience. 

## Types of machine leaning problems:
* Supervised: Presented with input data and desired outputs and asked to find pattern
  * Image classification 
  * Market prediction/ Rgression
* Unsupervised learning: No labels given, asked to find pattern in input.
  * CLustering
  * High-Dimension Visulization
  * Generative Models
* Semi-supervised learing: Some of the data is labeled, Semi-supervised learning is an approach to machine learning that combines small labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data during training.
  * Photo archive
* Reinforced Learning: Feedback in terms of reward and punishments, A learner is not told what actions to take as in most forms of machine learning but instead must discover which actions yield the most reward by trying them. 
### Types of Supervised Learning:
  * Classification:
    * Binary Classification ( Scam not scam)
    * MUlticlass CLassification
  * Regression: Outputs are continuous rather than discrete
### Types of Unsupervised learning:
  * Clusterning: Groups are not known before hand
  * Density estimation: Find distribution of inputs in space
  * Dimention reduction: Simplifies by mapping them into llower dimension space
### Terms in machine learning:
  * Model or hypothesis
  * Feature
  * Target or label
  * Training
  * Prediction
  * Learing: A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. 
### Steps of Machine learing:
1. Define the problem
2. Collect data
3. Explore the data
4. Pre-process Data
5. Split the data
6. Chose a model
7. Train the model
8. Evaluate the model
9. Fine tune the model
10. Deploy the model
11. MOnitor the model
